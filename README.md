Gossamer Minimal is a modification of Gossamer Dark, but with alsmost token colors removed to create a more focused environment. The philosophy of this theme is strongly influenced by Niki Tonsky's [Alabaster theme](https://github.com/tonsky/vscode-theme-alabaster).

## Gossamer Caramel

## Icons

Now this theme collection also includes a set of icons forked from Moxer Icons which were removed from the VS Marketplace due to suspicion of malicious code. This is an older fork, from before the suspusion code was inserted. There is nothing but pure SVG, and certainly no JS. You can check it in `themes/icons/icons.json` and `assets` folder.
